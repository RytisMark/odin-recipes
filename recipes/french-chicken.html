    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A recipe for French onion-breaded baked chicken. Very tasty! This recipe is for 4 servings.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup bread crumbs</li>
    	<li>1 (1 ounce) package dry French onion soup mix</li>
    	<li>1/3 cup mayonnaise</li>
    	<li>1 tablespoon garlic paste (optional)</li>
    	<li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Mix bread crumbs and dry soup mix together in a bowl.</li>
      <li>Mix mayonnaise and garlic paste together in a separate bowl. Microwave on high to thin out consistency, 20 to 30 seconds.</li>

      <li>Bake on the middle rack of the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
